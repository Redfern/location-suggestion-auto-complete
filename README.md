# Location suggestion auto complete

This is code made using the google maps api to retrieve an suggested / auto complete list of locations based on what you have input.

This works with google maps and will require javascript to use.

On line 15 you need to replace **INPUT-YOUR-KEY-HERE** with your own key from google.

You can get a key from https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key if you don't have one.

You will need the google maps places javascript api enabled also on that api key.
